# AdventOfCode

This is a collection of programs I wrote for the Advent of Code challenge, which is an annual series of programming challenges that run throughout the month of December. Each day, a new challenge is released that requires participants to solve a specific problem using programming.

These are by no means the best or optimal solutions and my code is pretty messy so please view it at your own discretion :)
