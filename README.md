# AdventOfCode2021

This is a collection of programs I wrote for the Advent of Code challenge, which is an annual series of programming challenges that run throughout the month of December. Each day, a new challenge is released that requires participants to solve a specific problem using programming.

In this repository, you will find a folder for each day of the challenge. Within each folder, you will find a program that solves the problem for that day.

These are by no means the best or optimal solutions and my code is pretty messy so please view it at your own discretion :)
